The road is really good!

We cycled all around the island by following the coastline most of the time.

The road was sealed all the way and about 70% of our route was a special lane shared by cyclists and motorcycles.

On busy streets or highways, people would always make room so you can ride safely on the side.

Taiwan has probably the safest roads for the 2-wheelers in Asia.

Besides, cycling, we experimented hitchhiking. 

It was not a piece of a cake since the locals are not used to this practise. If you stand on the side of the road, they would slow down thinking you need some help. We managed to get a few rides by writing our destination (in traditional Mandarin) on a big piece of cardboard.

The best approach is to talk to them directly if you can.
## {{< translate accommodations >}} | {{< score 4 >}}
Compared to other Asian countries, the price is above the average.

However, the accommodations are always clean and the staff is helpful.

Also, during the low season, it's possible to get a decent accommodation at a discounted price. Negotiation is your best friend.
## {{< translate freedom_camping >}} | {{< score 4 >}}
Taiwan is really urban and people are not used to freedom campers.

Around the city, we would ask the locals for a good spot or ask the temple managers if we can stay somewhere around.

In remote places, we would stay anywhere we would consider sheltered enough, and not too anoying for the locals. The police really don't mind you do freedom camping at random spots, but they may check on you if they think you are at risk. They might try to look for a proper accommodation for you, and give you food and hot beverages.
## {{< translate facilities >}} | {{< score 5 >}}
Taiwan is well equipped.

There are convinient stores almost everywhere.

For bikers and cyclists, there is nothing to worry about. You can find branded or private bike shops around every corner.

If you have any issue on the way, just go to the local police station. They can speak English, and they will provide anything you need. Some of them are official bike stations and even accommodations for travellers. 

## {{< translate communication_with_the_locals >}} | {{< score 4 >}}
If you can speak or read traditional Chinese, you are fine. Otherwise, it's not that easy, but not too difficult either.

The people who can speak English are:
- The police
- The accommodations' owners/managers
- Taipei people

For the rest, you will need to use your body language and/or you smartphone's translator.

Some of them can speak or understand Japanese.

And just forget about French. This language is absolutely useless in this part of the world.

In general, the Taiwanese are really patient and they will try their best to provide help. They will not hesitate to approach you to check on you if you look lost or tired.
## {{< translate food >}} | {{< score 5 >}}
Food is cheap and delicious!

Each village has their own specialties. For instance, we visited the village of spring onions. They would add fresh spring onions in every dish. We even had spring onion ice cream!

More seriously, food is accessible everywhere. Shops, restaurants, night markets, supermarket... You really don't need to worry about it.
#### {{< translate vegetarian_friendly >}} {{< score 4 >}}
Vegetarism is a religious practise in Taiwan. Around the city, you can find many shops that serve traditional vegetarian food.

They also have many veggie options for the dumplings and bao.

In the countryside, they might not have a vegetarian menu, but you can ask for a plate of stir fried veggies with rice.
