## Why this bicycle?
Our first plan was to use a classic tandem for our next long-distance tours.
One day, we decided to rent one and we realized that there was a lot of drawbacks compared to a standard bicycle.
One the major issues was that the stoker's view was halved by the captain's back.
Which we thought was less than ideal for travelling, although we could communicate more easily.

That's about when we learnt about the Hase Pino tandem, a semi-recumbent tandem.
Basically, it means that the captain has an upright position, whereas the stoker is more or less laid back at the front. 

### Great features
- The frame design allows both riders to have a panoramic view while pedaling.
- Talking to each other is even easier.
- The tandem is highly adjustable with only a few tools. 
- The ride is smooth for both cyclists, even on rough terrains, thanks to the front shock.
- The stoker's crankset has a freewheel. 

### Things to improve
- Manoeuvering the handlebar requires a little bit of adaptation.
- Many parts are proprietary or Hase Pino specific.
- It's pricey.
