# The journey
This year, 2023, we will cross Eurasia from West to East.
"So what?", you may say. Well the catch here is that we are going to cycle it with a tandem, also infamously known as the "couple killer".
Jokes aside, our rules will be:
- Pedal on land
- Take ferries accross the seas
- Never take a flight
- Enjoy Life!

## A few stats
<li><b>{{< translate way_of_travelling >}}</b> Cycling and occasionnally ferries</li>
<li><b>{{< translate starting_date >}} </b>1 May 2023</li> 
<li><b>{{< translate duration >}}</b> 1 year and 8 months</li>
<li><b>{{< translate distance >}}</b> 28 000 km</li>

# Our motivation
The first and foremost reason is because we want to.
Our stay on this planet is limited, so we do the things we like, and we love discovering places by bicycle.
Cycling has a long list of benefits that overcomes its drawbacks.
But for us, it is the middle ground between exploration and speed. In other words, you get to enjoy the surroundings while still adding up kilometres.

Plus, it will keep us fit while keeping a reduced impact on our environment. We expect a little bit of challenges whenever we will have to cross hills and mountains.

Finally, the circumstances are favourable to take up this challenge now. A few years ago, we were supposed to go to Japan together. 
Unfortunately, the covid crisis lead us to France, our current location at the time of writing.
Which today represents our best opportunity to check this achievement from our bucket list and eventually reach Japan.


<!-- # Our planned route
We will start our journey in Marseille, France, as it is our current location.
We will first connect to Cape Roca, Portugal via Eurovélo 8, a.k.a. the "Mediterranean Route".
It will extend our already long journey by three months, but we want to explore the Iberian Peninsula more deeply.
Plus, it will allow us to get more experience with our new bicycle, without leaving the European Union.
If anything happens here to our tandem, it will probably be more convenient to get assistance compared to Asia.
Symbolically, it's the westernmost point of Europe and it makes the adventure even more exciting to us.

## Cape Roca (Portugal) to Muxia (Spain)
We will travel along the Eurovélo 1 for a little bit, before following the Camino Norte.
We have already hitchhiked the Camino Norte but this time we will challenge our fitness.
