## {{< translate "travel_story" >}}
Travelling Portugal by bicycle was part of our bigger project to cross [Eurasia by bicycle]({{< link_to "wish_eurasia" >}}).
More precisely, it was the Westernmost country on our plan, and thus, represented the start point of this long adventure.  

It was our first time, both Mina and I, to explore the country of Francisco Xavier, and had no prejudice nor expectation of this part of the world.
For Mina, Portugal was deeply bound to Japan's history for it had been one of a few that were allowed to trade with the Japanese for many centuries. For me, it was the country that brought the renown *pasteis de nata* to South East Asia and Oceania.

Of course, Portugal delighted us with much more than the little knowledge we had of it. Its landscapes, people, food, beverages and weather were astounding and kept us in the country a little bit longer than expected.

Crossing the border between Spain and Portugal consisted in crossing the Rio Guadiana by ferry. We did not get checked by any border officer.

As a French national, you can of course stay as long as you want in Portugal.

Mina had a partner visa which allowed her to stay inside the Schengen area for one year.

Otherwise, Japanese passports' holders can stay 90 days in 6 months inside the Schengen area.



### {{< translate "road_condition" >}}

We first rode Algarve, the Southern region, from East to West until Sagres, and then headed North until Porto by following the Atlantic coastline. From there, we went a little bit inland until Vila Real, and left the country via the *ecovia do Tamega e Corgo*, that ended in the municipality of Chaves.

Portugal is a hilly country. There was only little we could do to avoid the numerous ups and downs as our plan was to cross the country from end to end.

For us cyclists, the fastest way to connect between two towns was by taking the national roads. They could be recognized by their code names that started with the letter "N" followed by a number (For example, the "N2"). These roads were tarred and well-maintained. They also offered more "gentle" climbs than the other options. The main trade-off was that they were sometimes busy and narrow, but never to the point it endangered our ride.

One other option was the *ecovia*, also known as *ecopista* or *cyclopista*. Often repurposed railways, this kind of roads guaranteed an even safer route as they were built specifically for the pedestrians and the cyclists. However, many of them were either incomplete, or still under construction. The information on how to take them and their state was scarce on the internet and almost non-existent in the local i-sites.

Last but not least, it was possible to make our own route by following the side streets and local roads. The main benefit was that they were rarely busy outside of the large cities and could bring you closer to the more scenic places. Their condition, though, was unpredictable as their surface could go from perfectly smooth tar to rocky gravel within the same ten kilometres. Cobble-stoned roads are also a Portuguese special that proved to be harmful to our bearings and bolts.


### {{< translate "accommodations" >}}
We did not stay or even search any accommodation in Portugal. We are literally unable to provide any information on this matter.




### {{< translate "freedom_camping" >}}
{{< score 5 >}}
Freedom camping had never felt so easy and comfortable. The best places for this purpose were the public picnic areas located outside the villages, but not too far from their centers. They usually provided benches, tables, running water, rubbish bins and BBQ corners. Additionally, those quiet spots were fresh and shaded most of the time, ideal in summer when the temperatures peak at over 35¬∞C.

Otherwise, we also pitched the tent on beaches, near the rivers or around the lakes at a few occasions.

For the extremely rare times we could not find any appropriate tent sites, we asked the locals if we could camp inside their fields, which they accepted without hesitation.


### {{< translate "facilities" >}}
{{< score 5 >}}
Portugal was working really hard to promote ecotourism when we visited it. It resulted in the construction and renovation of numerous tracks that allowed us to enjoy the national parks for free. We appreciated to be able to admire the magnificent nature at no cost.

Asides the marvelous landscapes, the country had all the ingredients for a premium cycle tour experience! The bathrooms were easy to find and pristine clean; the water taps delivered fresh and tasty water at a high pressure; caf√©s, restaurants, grocery stores and supermarkets could be found everywhere and were selling quality products and produces.

For the more tech savvy of us, Free Wi-Fi hotspots were provided by supermarkets, petrol stations and some city centres. 

Regarding the payment methods, it was possible to pay with our debit card for our shopping ninety percent of the time. We kept our cash for only the fruit and vegetable stales on the side of the road.

During our tour in the country, we stumbled on mechanical issues with our bike more often than expected, and thus had to visit the bike shops regularly. On the bright side, it gave us the opportunity to discover the incredible professionalism of the Portuguese bike mechanics. Really patient and with an excellent understanding of the job, they would first diagnose our trouble by sight before either operating carefully or recommending us to a peer when they think they would not be up to the task.

### {{< translate "communication_with_the_locals" >}}
{{< score 5 >}}
The good news for us was that almost the entire population could speak either a perfect English or an excellent French, and probably many more languages. For the rest, the Portuguese language sounds close to both French and Spanish, making it easy for a latin speaker to communicate.

Moreover, the Portuguese were formidably mindful people! They always acknowledged our presence (for instance, making enough room for us to pedal in narrow passages), and did their best to offer accurate advice and useful assistance. And at the same time, they were not too rigid with the rules. A great balance between a careful mind and a free spirit.



### {{< translate "food" >}}
{{< score 5 >}}
The Portuguese excel in the pastries department. Besides the well-known *pasteis de nata*, each region has their own special sweets that always combine perfectly with a cup of coffee. In Algarve, our most significant discovery was the *folar de Olhao*, a sweet delicacy flavoured with a fair amount of cinnamon.

As for the beverages, Portugal is well-versed in the art of brewing coffee. There is a dozen variations available when the time comes to order you hot exlixir. We figured that having a chart of the different possibilities came handy. 

Regarding the fresh drinks, the country still have plenty to offer. We had a lot of fun sipping the most local specialties: the classic Sagres Beer in Sagres, white and red Port wine in Porto, or Pedras sparkling water straight from the spring in Pedras.

In the savoury category, we can mention the oversized sardines, the fantastic potato-based cuisine (stew, fried, baked, boiled...) and the exceptional *francesinha*! The last one resembled a French croque-madame, marinated in a gravy-ish sauce. Despite an uncanny look, the taste was actually delicate and delicious.

Overall, the Portuguese cuisine looks simple, but tastes wonderful, thanks to fresh and flagrant ingredients.

#### {{< translate vegetarian_friendly >}} {{< score 3 >}}
The typical Portuguese diet is not what we would call vegetarian friendly. In the touristic areas, vegetarian options could be found directly on the menu, but otherwise, we had to ask the staff if they could prepare a special vegetarian meal.
