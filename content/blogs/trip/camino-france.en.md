{{< collapsible "travel_story" 2 >}}
After more than one year of long distance relationship forced by the covid restrictions, Mina and I decided to reunite in France. It was a good opportunity to achieve one of the items on our long bucket list: hiking the Route of St James from the official French starting point in Le-Puy-En-Velay, until Santiago de Compostela in Spain.

In this article, we are focusing on the French part of this pilgrimage.

We are not religious people, but that worldwide famous pilgrimage was on our bucket list. Additionally, it was the Jubilee year of Santiago de Compostela. It happens when the 25th July falls on Sunday. For this special occasion, it is possible to visit the room where Saint James bones are stored.

The walk through the dramatic landscapes, the farm animals, and the historical villages felt like a refreshing breeze to our lives, especially during the covid crisis.

We entered Europe by plane.
At that time, we had to go through the covid checks. But travelling in France was fine.
We then took a train from Lyon until Le Puy-En-Velay, the starting point.

As a French national, you can of course stay as long as you want in France.

<h4>{{< translate Mina >}} üáØüáµ</h4>
Mina had a working holiday visa which allowed her to stay inside the Schengen area for one year.

Otherwise, Japanese passports' holders can stay 90 days in 6 months inside the Schengen area.

{{< collapsible "road_condition" 3 5 >}}
It's a popular hike, so the path is well marked and well maintained.
If you stick to the official route, you will find yourself zigzagging left and right, up and down.
If you decide to take shortcuts, you might miss several charming sceneries though.
Regarding the crowd, it's only busy at the beginning and towards Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port.
Nevertheless, even though the path condition is rather good, we would recommend to wear proper hiking shoes for their durability and comfort.
Mina first decided to use trail-running shoes, but regretted it as she had to changed them on the way.

{{< collapsible "accommodations" 3 4 >}}
There are plenty of lovely accommodations along the way.
It's better to book them as soon as possible to make sure you'll have a warm bed for the night.
But, we would never make a reservation for a place to stay because we wanted to follow the flow of this trip.

Additionally, carrying a tent can be useful as many owners allow to pitch tent in their gardens for about 5‚Ç¨ per person and per night.

Alternatively, you can stay at *donativos* in exchange of a donation left at your discretion. You cannot book them, though, and you will need to arrive early if you wish to find a vacant bed.

In the end, we only have a limited experience of 2 nights on campgrounds and 1 night in a *donativo*.

{{< collapsible "freedom_camping" 3 5 >}}
On the French part of Camino de Compostela, freedom camping is a common practice.
It's not unusual to share your spot with other campers. 
The locals are used to us, freedom campers. Sometimes, you can even find an ideal spot for freedom camping that has a few facilities (benches, bathrooms, plugs...) in the vicinity of the footpath.
If you'd like to pitch your tent on an empty field, make sure there won't be any farming activity (animals, vehicles...) the following morning.
