{{< collapsible "travel_story" 2 >}}
Visiting the UK was, at first, a choice of convenience.

We had to find a destination to spend our honeymoon, Mina had to reset her Schengen visa and we could only afford two weeks of holidays.
Eventually, what the country had to offer caught us off-guard, and we felt that those two weeks were too short.

We first wanted to visit our friends in Norwich, than head to the beginning of the Cotswold way, several hundred kilometres further West.

Planning this trip turned out to be a bit more difficult than expected.
Indeed, the railway workforce decided to strike the week we would arrive at Stansted airport. 
Fortunately, we could rely on our friends who gave us a ride until Oxford.
From there, we tried to get as close as possible to Chipping Campden by bus.
Once arrived at a neighbouring village, we managed to quickly hitchhike to Chipping Campden, where we could begin our hike.

Overall, visiting this country was a lovely experience. We passed through a bunch of places, but this article will mainly focus on the Cotswold Way.

Plane, easy

As a French national, you just need to present your ID card or your passport.

<h4>{{< translate Mina >}} üáØüáµ</h4>
Mina had a long-stay visa for France which allowed her to stay inside the Schengen area. Corsica is part of France, i.e. part of the Schengen area.

Otherwise, Japanese passports' holders can stay 90 days in 6 months inside the Schengen area.
