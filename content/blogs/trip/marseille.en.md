In the year 2021, upon completion of our sacred pilgrimage to Santiago, Spain, we embarked on a perilous journey back to France, with nothing but our wits and a sturdy hitchhiking thumb. Our ultimate goal was to return to the land of the rising sun, Japan, by way of Paris. Alas, the dreaded Covid-19 still had a tight grip on the world, making our journey fraught with complications.

Thus, we found ourselves in the charming port city of Marseille, a place we had never before visited. Here, we were compelled to make a detour to the Japanese consulate, in order to secure the necessary documents for our return to Japan. And so it was that we stayed in Marseille for many months, biding our time and engaging in a delightful exchange of labor at a lovely estate.

Yet, fate had a cruel twist in store for us. The news arrived like a thunderbolt: my visa for Japan had been placed on indefinite hold, until the Covid crisis abated - a full year later, as it turned out. Such a dire turn of events forced us to reconsider our options and make a momentous decision: to remain in France and establish a new life there, together.

With a sense of serendipity, we returned to the city that had captured our hearts: Marseille. Though the task of settling in a foreign land proved to be a formidable challenge, fraught with an endless barrage of bureaucratic hurdles, Marseille held a special place in our hearts. Here, we found a glimmer of hope and the possibility of negotiating and smoothing things over, in a city that was brimming with life and vitality.

And so it was that we remained in Marseille for a duration of 16 months, immersing ourselves in the culture and the people, and forging unforgettable memories that we wish to share with you, dear reader, in this account.

### Travelling and commuting in France
{{< score 5 >}}

In the vast expanse of France, the options for travel from one place to another are plentiful. Each mode of transportation offers a unique combination of comfort and affordability, perfect for any journey.

#### Ferries
For those who yearn to cross waters, ferries are often overlooked as a convenient mode of travel. Cyclists in particular find ferries to be a hassle-free solution when transporting their beloved bikes. The journey is comfortable and from the port of Marseille, one can easily reach a variety of destinations such as Corsica, Algeria, and Sardinia. Prices vary depending on the season, so it is recommended to book as soon as possible, lest the fares increase greatly as the departure date approaches.

#### Planes
Although planes are a swift means of travel for longer distances, we often try to avoid them due to their huge carbon footprint and inconvenience when travelling with bicycles. In addition, reaching the airport can be time-consuming, as can checking in. We reserve air travel for longer distances when time is of the essence. Domestic flights can sometimes be cheaper than trains.

#### Trains
Local transports, managed by localities, such as buses, trams, rental bikes, and subways, offer a cost-effective means of travel with a standard fare of around 2 euros for up to 100 kilometers. Although limited in schedule, these modes of transport can be utilized for travel throughout most of France. In Marseille, rental bikes were particularly affordable, costing only 5 euros per year upon our arrival. It is worth noting that employees in France can request their company to refund half of their monthly public transport subscription.

#### Coaches
For long distances, coaches are the most affordable option, allowing travelers to traverse hundreds of kilometers for just a few euros. Comfort levels vary greatly between each coach, and in peak season, they can be quite packed. If carrying numerous bags, it is wise to embark first. As coaches depend on the road network, delays and traffic jams are common. The main operators in France are Flixbus and Blablabus.

#### Local transports
Local transports, managed by localities, such as buses, trams, rental bikes, and subways, offer a cost-effective means of travel with a standard fare of around 2 euros for up to 100 kilometers. Although limited in schedule, these modes of transport can be utilized for travel throughout most of France. In Marseille, rental bikes were particularly affordable, costing only 5 euros per year upon our arrival. It is worth noting that employees in France can request their company to refund half of their monthly public transport subscription.

#### Cabs on demand
Cabs on demand, such as Uber, are convenient for specific situations but are not our preferred method of transportation. These apps are available 24/7 and can even be used to plan a trip for someone else.

#### Car pooling
Car pooling, a popular practice in France, offers a simple and affordable means of travel. We use blablacar.com, a website that allows us to plan trips with just a few clicks. The driver's profile can be checked to reduce the risk of an undesirable ride, and car pooling is a great way to meet people and gain insight into places to visit.

#### Hitchhiking
Finally, hitchhiking, although not as common as it once was, is a personal favorite of ours. While it may take some social skills to approach drivers parked at petrol stations, hitchhiking provides an exciting adventure with each new ride, and the chance to meet fascinating people. Although it was more difficult to find rides in the aftermath of the Covid crisis, our advice is to ask drivers directly, for it is the most effective way.

### Settling in Marseille
{{< score 3 >}}

In France, the process of settling down is no simple feat. Such was our experience, Mina and I. Mina, lacking French citizenship, and myself, registered in the distant land of New Caledonia - a peculiar status, akin to that of an immigrant.

The initial hurdle one must surmount is obtaining a visa - a necessity for entry into France and the Schengen area. As a French national, I faced no significant obstacles, but Mina arrived with a mere working holiday visa for Spain, later converting it into a visitor visa through border crossings with the UK. For a lengthier stay, we resolved to unite in Marseille, affording us eligibility for a partner visa.

The bureaucratic ordeal of marrying in France is quite cumbersome in the present day. The constraints imposed upon marriage vary by the city council of the betrothal. The principal prerequisite is to officiate the ceremony in the town hall of one's official residence, or that of one's parents. In view of this, we chose Marseille as the optimal location for our nuptials.

However, proving our residency in Marseille necessitated much exertion. We were obliged to establish official residence in the city, precluding short-term lodging as a viable option. We had to procure a long-term apartment, a tedious process we explain in the following section.

Finally, it should be noted that a gratuity enrolment in the French healthcare system, also referred to as *Caisse Primaire d'Allocation Maladie*, is awarded to all those residing in France for an extended period. It permits the beneficiaries to receive a refund of up to 70% on their medical expenses in most instances. Nonetheless, the process of acquiring it is, to put it mildly, chaotic. The regulations seem to be altered every other year, and the public servants' information is inconsistent. As daunting as it may seem, we made headway when we decided to handle the situation by persistently harassing the officials on the phone. We had initially believed that our situation was an unfortunate exception, but we later discovered that several of our acquaintances had encountered similar experiences.

### Finding an apartment
{{< score 2 >}}
In the bustling city of Marseille, many French families seek refuge in search of a more comfortable life. However, this surge in demand for accommodation has led to a highly competitive real estate market that is unfavourable for rental seekers. The most desirable properties are snapped up quickly, leaving many prospective tenants to compete against a sea of applicants from various backgrounds.

In Marseille, one can either rent from a real estate agency or directly from the property owners. Though these two methods differ in several aspects, they share some common requirements. Potential tenants must provide the usual identification documents, such as an ID card or passport, and demonstrate their ability to pay rent sustainably. This often proves to be a daunting task for newcomers to the country who may struggle to meet the strict financial criteria, such as having a long-term employment contract and a salary at least three times higher than the rent. Even, when those conditions were met, you would need to provide French payslips or tax invoices, items you might not possess if you had not been in France for while.

Our experience with real estate agencies in Marseille left much to be desired. We encountered frequent cancellations of appointments mere hours before the scheduled meeting, and the required documentation was often difficult to provide. Despite our solid financial situation, we were repeatedly turned down.

Determined to find a solution, we turned to directly contacting property owners. Unfortunately, such offers are scarce and are often posted by scammers looking to steal personal information. To avoid such traps, it is best to meet the landlord in person. We were fortunate enough to find our dream apartment through a marketplace for individuals called [leboncoin.fr](https://leboncoin.fr). Though sifting through the numerous offers posted by older users was a bit challenging, we eventually secured a beautiful apartment in a quiet neighbourhood between the city center and the seaside. To secure the deal, we agreed to pay three months' rent in advance after some negotiations.

To facilitate the application process, some mechanisms can be helpful. [Dossierfacile.fr](https://dossierfacile.fr) is a government-run platform that improves the legitimacy of your application by reviewing each document uploaded by a public officer. Additionally, [visale.fr](https://visale.fr) offers the option for those with weaker applications to use public services as guarantors, but this system is often rejected by most real estate agencies and may be overlooked by property owners as it demande to be accustomed to using online services.
