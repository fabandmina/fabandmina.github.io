You can help us by donating a little money via the button above. It will allow us to treat ourselves better on the way.

## Become a sponsor
We would be happy to represent your brand if your business matches our values and interests. If you think we can be an asset for your communication strategy, please contact us via the contact form.
We would be particularly interested in receiving the following items from you:
- 2-person tent
- tools
- clothing
- bike accessories
- backpacks

## Accommodate us on the way
Sometimes, we need to stay overnight at a sheltered place. It could be a place in your garden, a corner in your garage... We would be glad to share our adventures with you around a cup of tea.
