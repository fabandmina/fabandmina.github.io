# Fab and Mina: Travel with us
Welcome!

{{< param introduction >}}
We are happy to share our experience with you. Hopefully it will give you new ideas that will make a positive impact in your life, and inspire you to take up on new challenges. 
#
Our next project is to cross Eurasia by tandem bicycle from Portugal to Japan. It will take about two years and 28,000 km.

## Who are Fab and Mina?
{{< portrait >}}
We are a married couple that made travelling their lifestyle. 
We met in New Zeland and have visited a few countries together since then. 
We mainly use slow means of transportation. It makes our trips more fun and interesting.
We are curious and adventurous, but what we enjoy the most is trying new food!
