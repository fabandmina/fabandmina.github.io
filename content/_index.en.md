# Fab and Mina: Travel with us
{{< param introduction >}}
{{< last-article >}}

## Who are Fab and Mina?
We are a married couple that made travelling their lifestyle. 
We met in New Zeland and have visited a few countries together since then. 
We mainly use slow means of transportation. It makes our trips more fun and interesting.
We are curious and adventurous, but what we enjoy the most is trying new food!
