## The Kit
We recently purchased the Trangia Stove 27-2 UL, a compact cooking kit designed for use while camping in harsh environments (stong wind, snow...). The kit includes two saucepans, a frypan, a kettle, a windshield, and a handle, all made of lightweight aluminum. The components fold into each other to form a compact set that weighs only 825g, making it easy to carry. The kit also comes with a spirit burner, which provides a reliable and efficient source of heat.

Additionally, we ordered an extra plate and a fuel bottle for storing the spirit from the same company. 

## Why this cooking kit?
For years, we relied on a hiking gas stove that never failed us and was easy to carry. However, we often struggled to find compatible cartridges, especially when flying, and started thinking about upgrading our cooking system.

We considered two options: a fuel burner or a spirit burner. Fuel had the advantage of being widely available and inexpensive, but the smell was quite strong, and not every petrol station sold small amounts of fuel. After weighing the pros and cons, we decided to go with a spirit burner, which had a more bearable smell, was easier to purchase in small amounts, and could be found at hardware stores or supermarkets, at least in Europe.

Mina researched the spirit stove market extensively and discovered that Trangia had been selling the same design of spirit burners for almost a century. They offered many different configurations to suit every need, and we ultimately chose their lightest version sized for two people. 

## Our impressions on this cooking kit
As for other spirit burners, our experience may be limited, but we have found great satisfaction in our own. This compact, lightweight, and portable travel companion has truly amazed us with its impressive power and optimized flame, all thanks to the efficient windshield system.

Remarkably, our cooking time has remained just as consistent as that of a gas stove, and the additional pots and pans have allowed for an even greater variety of meals. Yet, we do lament that the included frypan does not serve as a perfect lid for the saucepans during cooking. One could acquire regular lids from Trangia, but we did not wish to indulge in the extravagance of an accessory with only one function.

However, we must note that the set is vulnerable to scratches during transportation due to its rough edges, though this can be remedied by wrapping each item in fabric.

When it comes to the spirit, we recommend selecting one with 90% alcohol and as little methanol as possible, for the latter can release harmful fumes.

The flames produced by this device are not only blissfully silent, but they also bear a resemblance to the flickering flames of a wooden chimney fire. Truly, such an ambiance provides a sense of peace and tranquility during our camping excursions.

All in all, this valuable addition has made our long-distance tours all the more comfortable and enjoyable.
