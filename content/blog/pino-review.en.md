## More than 10,000 km and still on the road!
At the time of writing, we have been cycling for a year through Eurasia and we expect to reach the finish line towards the end of 2024. It is now a good time to review our dear semi-recumbent tandem with a little bit of hindsight and attempt to figure out the following: *How good of a tourer is the Hase Pino 2021?*

## Pino does not make your tour easier...
The short answer is *not so good but could be worse*. Compared to other globetrotters who have tackled similar projects, the 2021 model is still more or less holding all its nuts and bolts in place, and so far, nothing has put a final stop to our journey.

That being said, we had to delay or replan numerous times because of various things going wrong with the bicycle itself. It did impact negatively our motivation to keep riding.

On the other side of the scale, the ride itself is utterly comfortable for both cyclists and that is probably its main strength. Also, it survived the harsh winter at high elevations. A real **tank**, as long as you stick to the tar road.

Now if you are stubbornly decided, like we were, to make the Pino 2021 your new travel mate, here are several points yous should be aware of. Had we known about them sooner, our travel experience would have improved dramatically.

### Get a condition!
The Pino 2021 is **heavy!** Thinking that you will be able to stay sat on the saddle no matter the steepness of the hills you will climb is just nonsense. At least, the stoker will have to get off as soon as the inclination passes 7%.
### The steering system is a major concern
### Strong brakes at a price!
### Improve your comfort
pedals, saddle and kickstand
### Rohloff, a bad integration of a great technology  
### The cabling disappoints
### Build your own wheels
### Stand your ground with the manufacturer!

## Plan your service days
### Sourcing the spare parts
### Finding good mechanics
### Taking care of your speed hub
### Lubricating the chain

## Would we recommend it for touring?

Person who is planning to tour with a tandem.
