## {{< translate "travel_story" >}}
Our journey to cross Eurasia led us to pedal through Spain not once, but twice. The first spin served as a practice ride, taking us to the starting line in Portugal. The second entry marked the official start of our adventure toward Japan.

Although we had visited some places before, the experience felt refreshingly different on a bicycle, especially when retracing the familiar paths of the [Camino de Santiago]({{< link_to "camino-spain" >}}). Having previously explored Spain on foot, the landscape took on a new perspective, becoming the perfect testing ground for our novel bicycle and revealing both its strengths and weaknesses along the way.

We crossed the Spanish border six times at the following places:
- The Col de Panissars
- Gilbratar
- The Rio Guadiana
- The Feces de Abaixo
- The Bidasoa

We passed the border without encountering any police officers, except in Gibraltar.

As a French national, you can of course stay as long as you want in Spain.

Mina had a partner visa which allowed her to stay inside the Schengen area for one year.

Otherwise, Japanese passports' holders can stay 90 days in 6 months inside the Schengen area.



### {{< translate "road_condition" >}}
{{< score 5 >}}
Our initial plan was to contour the whole Iberian Peninsula by sticking to the coastline. However, due to the bad weather conditions, we had to reroute inland sometimes. In the North part of Spain, after Portugal, we decided to cycle on the  already-explored Camino de Santiago Frances, instead of discovering the Camino Norte. For the Final part, we followed the N1 highway as it was the shortest way until the border. 

Our feelings regarding cycling in Spain are mostly positive. The roads are in neat conditions and often contains multiple spacious lanes, sometimes including a dedicated one for the cyclists. Also the drivers are really considerate and left a massive space to pedal safely, even on narrower paths. The more adventurous tourers would also appreciate the numerous gravel tracks that expanded over countless kilometres and offering privileged spots to contemplate the landscapes.

### {{< translate "accommodations" >}}
{{< score 4 >}}
Spain caters to various budgets and preferences with a diverse range of accommodations. During our journey, we made use of these options twice ‚Äì once in Elxe and once in Granada. Concerned about the safety of our tandem, we consistently chose accommodations on the outskirts where hotels offered more space and proved to be more affordable than their centrally located counterparts. Notably, the hotels' staff was not only welcoming but also bicycle-friendly, adding an extra layer of comfort to our stay. Overall, the cost of accommodations tends to fall within the mid-to-upper tier for Europe, especially during the high-peak season.

### {{< translate "freedom_camping" >}}
{{< score 4 >}}
During our previous adventure tracing the Camino de Santiago in Spain, pitching our tent was a carefree affair. However, this time around, we adopted a more cautious approach. On a few occasions, the police gently reminded us that freedom camping wasn't their cup of tea, although the locals appeared more lenient. On the upside, the mountains generously presented numerous picturesque spots for overnight stays, while the beaches occasionally offered refreshing free showers.

And, just as it was during our initial journey, a friendly reminder: beware of the sprinklers!

### {{< translate "facilities" >}}
{{< score 5 >}}
Fantastic overall!

Abundant drinking water sources, numerous supermarkets with free Wi-Fi (also found at petrol stations and i-sites), several conveniently located bike shops, and well-situated picnic spots. Plus, credit/debit cards are universally accepted without any conditions.

As for restrooms, while public toilets were not abundant, it's widely accepted to request the use of facilities at cafes, bars, and petrol stations


### {{< translate "communication_with_the_locals" >}}
{{< score 5 >}}
Being our second visit to the country, we had already become acquainted with the locals and nuances of their language. This time around, everything went exceptionally smoothly.

In the larger cities, English is commonly spoken.


### {{< translate "food" >}}
{{< score 5 >}}
Portuguese culinary prowess shines brightly, particularly in the realm of pastries. Beyond the renowned *pasteis de nata*, each region boasts its own delectable sweets, seamlessly complementing a steaming cup of coffee. Our culinary exploration in Algarve led us to a noteworthy discovery‚Äîthe *folar de Olhao*, a sweet delicacy generously infused with the warm notes of cinnamon.

In the art of coffee brewing, Portugal is a maestro, offering a dazzling array of a dozen variations for the discerning palate. A handy chart detailing the diverse possibilities proved invaluable in navigating this rich coffee culture.

Refreshing beverages in Portugal are as diverse as they are delightful. Our taste buds reveled in local specialties such as the classic Sagres Beer in Sagres, white and red Port wine in Porto, and Pedras sparkling water sourced directly from the spring in Pedras.

In the savory department, oversized sardines, the versatile and fantastic potato-based dishes (stews, fried, baked, boiled), and the extraordinary *francesinha* stand out. Resembling a French croque-madame, the *francesinha* bathed in a savory sauce surprises with its delicate and delicious taste, despite its unconventional appearance.

On the whole, Portuguese cuisine, though seemingly uncomplicated, dazzles the palate with its wonderful flavors, owing much to the use of fresh and aromatic ingredients. Each dish is a testament to the culinary finesse that elevates simplicity to an exquisite art form.

#### {{< translate vegetarian_friendly >}} {{< score 3 >}}
The traditional Portuguese diet, regrettably, doesn't align seamlessly with what one might consider vegetarian-friendly. In tourist hubs, limited vegetarian options were occasionally presented on the menu. However, in other locales, we found it necessary to engage with the staff directly, kindly requesting their assistance in crafting a special vegetarian meal tailored to our dietary preferences.
