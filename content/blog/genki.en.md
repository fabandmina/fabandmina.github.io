## A health insurance is important
Meet Mina in 2019, our adventurous globetrotter, embarking on a bike tour through the breathtaking landscapes of New Zealand. Picture this: middle of nowhere, a mountain trail, and a sudden, sharp pain in her left foot. No one in sight, no phone signal, and the nearest village a daunting thirteen kilometers away. Limping with her bike in tow, she finally reaches the village, only to find a basic clinic with no fancy gadgets like an X-ray scanner.

Fast forward a week, and Mina is still in pain. Hesitating due to her expired travel insurance and worries about potential costs, she eventually seeks further medical help. Lucky for her, the local healthcare system covers the aftermath of her accident.

Now, let's talk real talk for a moment. Sure, paying for insurance upfront might feel like a spend, especially when everything's smooth sailing. But, take it from Mina – when the unexpected hits during a year-long adventure, it's worth every penny.

Here's the lowdown for all you fellow wanderers considering the insurance debate:


- **Well-being First:** Prioritize your health; it's the key to unlocking your dreams and conquering your goals.

- **Emergency Preparedness:** Medical emergencies can strike anywhere, and being in an unfamiliar place increases the odds of falling ill.

- **Treatment Price Tags:** Be mindful of the price tags tied to treatments, especially considering the type of care you might need and the country you find yourself in – costs can quickly pile up.

- **Financial Peace of Mind:** Imagine having a safety net; with insurance, you can rush to the doctor without hesitating, ensuring your well-being comes first, not financial worries.

- **Travel Savvy:** Before you set out on your adventures, be proactive – check out the extent of your coverage in the local healthcare system of your destination. Sometimes, your payment card subscription also includes a travel insurance with conditional coverage. It's a savvy move for a smooth and worry-free journey.


※ *So, get this—Mina actually met her life partner thanks to that incident! But hey, even with those unexpected love twists, we still say having insurance is a smart move.*

## Why we chose Genki insurance
Thanks to our myriad adventures, we've gained some experience with insurances for travellers. With a plethora of options catering to diverse needs, selecting the right one can be challenging. Here's why we opted for Genki on our journey across Eurasia:

### What is Genki
**Genki** stands out as a German company specializing in health insurance crafted explicitly for Digital Nomads and World Residents. This unique product is backed by the reputable names of *Dr. Walter* and *Allianz*, well-known entities in the European insurance realm.

Genki provides two distinct plans: *Genki Explorer* and *Genki Residents*. The latter encompasses all the features of the first plan and offers enhanced overall coverage along with a host of additional features.

The term *genki* finds its roots in the Japanese kanji "元気," translating to "good health," "lively," and "energetic." It perfectly encapsulates the essence of what their health insurance aims to promote for the dynamic and on-the-go lifestyle of digital nomads.


※ *We love this name!*

### What plan we chose
We opted for the *Genki Explorer* insurance plan for our Eurasian journey, anticipating that we would not participate in high-risk sports or activities like skydiving or bungee jumping, and judging that our health (eyes,teeth and mental) was a in great condition before starting our adventure. This plan perfectly met all our specific requirements.

The following features are also included in the *Genki Explorer* plan:	
- 24/7 emergency assistance	
- Direct billing (any hospital)
- Repatriation to your home country
- Connectivity with Air Doctor application to organize your medical appointments all around the world, offers the possibility to bill the insurance directly

### Signing Up
You can subscribe online by following our referral link.

The process is fairly simple as you can complete it online without any additional paperwork. For instance, providing a proof of residency is not required.

The subscription process is flexible, allowing you to join or interrupt your subscription anytime and anywhere, even while on your journey. However, please be aware of the 14-day waiting period after signing up, during which coverage is partial. Once this period concludes, you enjoy full 100% coverage.

Regarding the payment method, we provided our debit cards details and proceeded to be charged monthly. The process was also seamless.


## Our impressions on Genki
{{< score 5 >}}
Genki seems to be a great insurance provider that offers a fantastic solution for globe-trotters that are looking to mitigate the risks of their journeys.

The first thing that should be mentioned is how easy it is to sign up. Everything can be done online and requires a mere ten minutes of your time. We were not requested to provide any further documents such as a detailed planning of our route or a proof of residency, as it is sometimes the case with other companies. To finalize the sign up process, you are requested to pay for the first insured month. From there, you will be charged the same day monthly. No need to pay the total cost for a year upfront, but avoid delays in your payment as it might affect the benefits of your plans. What adds to the flexibility of the plan is that you can interrupt it at any time and it will take effect at the end of the ongoing month.

Regarding the quality of service, from their customer support to their insurance plans, everything feels like it has been crafted with benevolence and care for the client. For example, if you stay at the hospital for five days or more, even the first-price plan will not only cover your stay and treatment without any limit, but also the transportation fees for one of your relatives until the premises.
Another instance of their great support is when we requested to rephrase our insurance certificates to meet the visa application requirements for several picky countries. They reacted quickly and with efficiency.

Where's the catch? 

Well, the only thing that we wished they had was a liability insurance. Genki does not pretend to offer complete travel insurances but **health** insurances for travellers. So it makes sense that liability is not part of their offers. We were not interested in insuring our belongings either, as typically bundled by travel insurances, thus we are actually satisfied with this missing option. As result, their pricing is also reduced compared to the one of a standard travel insurance.

Other great features that can be mentioned are coverage in your home country (for a limited amount of time), connected to Air Doctor (application to schedule your medical appointments worldwide), direct billing to the hospital... and so on.

To conclude, we are currently touring across Eurasia by tandem bicycle, and chose *Genki Explorer* to power our safety on the way. Our experience with them has been tremendously positive so far. After this adventure finishes, we might consider to upgrade our plan to *Genki Resident*, which seems to align with our lifestyle and personalities.
