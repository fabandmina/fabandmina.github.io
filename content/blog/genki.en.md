## A health insurance is important
Meet Mina in 2019, our adventurous globetrotter, embarking on a bike tour through the breathtaking landscapes of New Zealand. Picture this: middle of nowhere, a mountain trail, and a sudden, sharp pain in her left foot. No one in sight, no phone signal, and the nearest village a daunting thirteen kilometers away. Limping with her bike in tow, she finally reaches the village, only to find a basic clinic with no fancy gadgets like an X-ray scanner.

Fast forward a week, and Mina is still in pain. Hesitating due to her expired travel insurance and worries about potential costs, she eventually seeks further medical help. Lucky for her, the local healthcare system covers the aftermath of her accident.

Now, let's talk real talk for a moment. Sure, paying for insurance upfront might feel like a spend, especially when everything's smooth sailing. But, take it from Mina – when the unexpected hits during a year-long adventure, it's worth every penny.

Here's the lowdown for all you fellow wanderers considering the insurance debate:

######

- **Well-being First:** Prioritize your health; it's the key to unlocking your dreams and conquering your goals.

- **Emergency Preparedness:** Medical emergencies can strike anywhere, and being in an unfamiliar place increases the odds of falling ill.

- **Treatment Price Tags:** Be mindful of the price tags tied to treatments, especially considering the type of care you might need and the country you find yourself in – costs can quickly pile up.

- **Financial Peace of Mind:** Imagine having a safety net; with insurance, you can rush to the doctor without hesitating, ensuring your well-being comes first, not financial worries.

- **Travel Savvy:** Before you set out on your adventures, be proactive – check out the extent of your coverage in the local healthcare system of your destination. It's a savvy move for a smooth and worry-free journey.

※ *So, get this—Mina actually met her life partner thanks to that incident! But hey, even with those unexpected love twists, we still say having insurance is a smart move.*

## Genki

### What is Genki
**Genki** stands out as a German company specializing in health insurance crafted explicitly for Digital Nomads and World Residents. This unique product is backed by the reputable names of *Dr. Walter* and *Allianz*, well-known entities in the European insurance realm.

The term *genki* finds its roots in the Japanese kanji "元気," translating to "good health," "lively," and "energetic." It perfectly encapsulates the essence of what their health insurance aims to promote for the dynamic and on-the-go lifestyle of digital nomads.

※ *We love this name!*

### Who could be interested?
Sometimes people have a travel insurance on their payment card covering medical expanses for overseas stays limited two a few months.

Sometimes your national health insurance covers your medical expanses overseas, under the same conditions as if you were in your home country.



We think that the service provided by health insurance could benefit people travelling for a long term. Some of us long tourers might already have an existing travel insurance on their payment cards or a national insurance covering their overseas travels, but these often come with many limitations such as:
- limited stay overseas
- limited refunded amounts
- complicated procedures with a lot of paperwork
