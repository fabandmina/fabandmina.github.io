Our journey through Tunisia unfolded unexpectedly during our Eurasian crossing. Initially not part of our planned route, it became essential when Croatia joined the Schengen area in 2023, limiting our options to reset Mina's visa. Despite the unforeseen detour, exploring Tunisia turned out to be a fantastic and refreshing experience.

The country's great history added an extra layer of fascination to our travels. Engaging with the Tunisian people enriched our trip, providing unique insights and making our journey even more interesting. The two weeks we spent there felt definitely too short and we wish we had stayed longer to appreciate the remotest places.

We embarked on our journey to Tunisia via a 24-hour ferry operated by *Grimaldi Lines* from [Italy]({{< link_to italy >}}). The vessel was good enough, and acting swiftly, we secured prime spots on the main deck, avoiding the crowded floor where most passengers settled with inflated mattresses. Due to the priority granted to bicycle travelers, we snagged a deluxe space near the restaurant, while our trusty two-wheeler found secure lodgings in a specially designated storage room.

Arriving at the port, we were directed to the pedestrian gates on the third floor, accessible only by taking a lengthy and winding ramp, as motorized vehicle gates were off-limits. Following a thorough screening, including our bicycle, by the border police officer, a swift check of our belongings ensued, and we were promptly on our way.

Exiting the country proved to be a more cumbersome process. Initially, we underwent a scan of our belongings upon entering the port facility. Subsequently, we faced multiple inquiries about our medications. While having a prescription might have facilitated the process, we hadn't considered obtaining one, as all our medicines could be purchased without a prescription in France. Following extended negotiations with several officers, we finally received permission to have our bicycle scanned and proceed to embarkation, navigating the same long and winding staircase.

We also observed a Tunisian passenger undergoing intense questioning due to carrying cash, even though the amount was only equivalent to 10 euros. The officer thoroughly scrutinized him, causing a significant delay. Fortunately, we had already spent all our Tunisian dinars before reaching the gates.

In total, each border check took about an hour.

Additionally, an outbound ferry or flight ticket reservation is required to be able to enter Tunisia. Providing a proof of hotel reservation for the whole length of our stay made the screening process even smoother.

Upon our arrival in Tunis, we eagerly charted a course for the rejuvenating hot springs of Korbous in the North-Eastern reaches of the country. Our journey then unfolded southward, leading us to the captivating city of Kairouan, where we took a brief hiatus to savor the offerings of the region. Embarking on the return leg to the capital, we indulged in a detour through the enchanting locale of Hammam Bent Jidi, lingered around the North of Tunis and Carthage before concluding our adventure with a ferry ride back to Italy.

Traversing the arid roads of Tunisia on our bicycles offered a distinctive experience, one that left us with a myriad of emotions. On the positive side, the road itself was nothing short of exceptional. Its surface, akin to polished marble, extended seamlessly for hundreds of kilometers, even in the remotest areas.

Conversely, the traffic proved to be somewhat tumultuous, particularly in the vicinity of bustling towns. Horizontal and vertical road markings were scarce, and encounters with unannounced roadworks were not uncommon. Despite these challenges, we adeptly navigated around obstacles, successfully evading most potential hazards.

Another factor contributing to the complexity of our journey was the behavior of car drivers. Beyond urban areas, they exhibited a considerate driving demeanor, providing ample space for our safety. However, within city limits, their actions became unpredictable, frequently ignoring the road direction and having a tendency to disregard traffic priorities and signals. Regrettably, we found ourselves on the receiving end of a rear-end collision, though the circumstances remain a mystery. We were progressively coming to a stop, followed by a driver behind at sluggishly over a hundred metres, when suddenly we got our bicycle rammed and our bodies thrown onto the floor by that same driver. Miraculously, the incident bore no lasting consequences.

A final note of caution pertains to the various living beings sharing the roads. Expect encounters with camels, horses, donkeys, and sheep, navigating alongside other vehicles, even in the bustling capital. Surprisingly, these animals are accustomed to the traffic and rarely pose complications. Additionally, stray dogs, while not aggressive, may express discomfort if you linger within their territory for an extended period.

### {{< translate "accommodations" >}}
{{< score 4 >}}
During our travels, we opted for paid accommodations on only two occasions – once in Kairouan and once in Tunis. Fortunately, being in the low season worked to our advantage, as finding available rooms proved effortless. On both occasions, we simply strolled in and directly inquired at the reception. The room rates were calculated per individual and consistently covered breakfast. In bustling tourist hubs, card payments were accepted; however, cash remained the predominant and widely accepted method of payment.

We were pleased to find that the rooms were clean on each occasion, adding to the overall positive experience. Additionally, the accommodation staff readily accommodated our request for bicycle storage upon inquiry, demonstrating their commitment to guest satisfaction and convenience.

### {{< translate "freedom_camping" >}}
{{< score 4 >}}
While we generally felt secure during our travels, it's advisable to avoid venturing too far from the main road, as locals often deem certain areas dangerous. Interestingly, people in most places didn't seem to mind if you chose to stay overnight. Even in proximity to beach resorts, it's usually acceptable, provided you confirm with the warden beforehand.

Police checks were a common occurrence, and while the interactions were friendly, they occasionally happened during the night, sometimes multiple times. Despite this, the overall atmosphere remained safe and accommodating.

If you're in need of a camping spot, don't hesitate to approach locals – feel free to ask anyone around for guidance on suitable locations to pitch your tent. Locals are usually more than willing to share information on permissible areas for camping.

Navigating essentials while traveling in this region requires a bit of local insight. When it comes to staying hydrated, although bottled water is readily available, finding drinkable tap water is impossible, except in a handful of villages built around natural springs. 

Public toilets are not a common sight. Petrol stations or cafés can be your go-to spots for restroom facilities.

When it comes to shopping, supermarkets offer the convenience of card payments but include additional extra fixed fees. Local grocery stores may not have price tags and will only accept cash. For unique finds and attractive prices, exploring local marketplaces is a must. The absence of fixed price tags allows for a more dynamic and interactive shopping experience. Embrace the opportunity to haggle and discover hidden gems in these vibrant markets.

Connectivity is a breeze, as free Wi-Fi access points are easy to come by. Whether you're in a café or public space, staying connected won't pose a challenge.

### {{< translate "communication_with_the_locals" >}}

Our encounter with the Tunisian people surpassed all expectations. The warmth and friendliness we experienced were truly remarkable, striking a perfect balance between hospitality and respect for personal space. Every interaction unfolded as an invitation to delve deeper into Tunisian culture, providing us with enriching opportunities.

One noteworthy aspect is the locals' impressive linguistic abilities. Communication proved seamless as they effortlessly switched between Arabic, French, English, and Italian. This multilingual proficiency not only eased our interactions but also highlighted the diversity and openness ingrained in the Tunisian society.

### {{< translate "food" >}}
{{< score 4 >}}
Outside the capital, the culinary landscape may not boast as much diversity, but it's a haven for certain culinary delights. Fresh dates and tomatoes, for instance, are not only inexpensive but also of exceptional quality, offering a delightful taste of local produce. When in Kairouan, indulging in the renowned makroud is a must – a delectable treat that encapsulates the region's culinary prowess.

The vibrant spice market adds a flavorful dimension to the culinary experience, with an array of tasty spices that elevate the local dishes. Additionally, the coffee culture is noteworthy, with good coffee being a staple part of the gastronomic scene.

However, it's worth noting that street shops and restaurants often serve similar fare, diminishing the novelty of dining at most establishments.

The Tunisian *makroud* from Kairouan is a delectable pastry, featuring a delicate blend of dates and semolina, meticulously handcrafted to perfection. With its irresistible taste, it's no wonder that a kilo of makroud can disappear in no time, leaving a sweet and aromatic memory that lingers on the palate.
