## We are Fab and Mina! 
We met in New Zeland and have travelled a few countries together since then. 
You can check our [trips >>.]({{< link_to "trip" >}})
We mainly use slow means of transportation. It makes our trips more fun and interesting.
We are curious and adventurous, but what we enjoy the most is trying new food!
